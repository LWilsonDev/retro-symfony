## Retro

This is a personal side-project. It will be an app to aid Sprint retrospectives, taken from Agile methodology. 

Users will be able to:
 
 - Log into their team board
 - Post notes in 3 categories
 - Create/Update/Delete notes
 - Add comments to notes
 - Mark notes as duplicates
 - Keep track of suggestions that team-members have raised
 - Vote on most important points raised
 - Automate the retrospective by sorting cards by votes
 - Form reports/PDFs at the end of each sprint
 - View past reports

I will be using this side-project to explore Symfony 5, and to further my knowledge of PHP.
